  The athenz_self_serve_group_members resource provides support for managing members of an existing athenz group, but only manages members defined in Terraform and ignores externally managed members
---

# athenz_self_serve_group_members (Resource)

`athenz_self_serve_group_members` provides an Athenz group resource that only manages members defined in Terraform configuration. Unlike the regular `athenz_group_members` resource, this resource does not sync with or affect members that were added outside of Terraform (e.g., through the UI, API, or other tools).

## Key Differences from athenz_group_members

- **Read Operation**: Only reads members that are defined in the Terraform state, not all members in the system
- **Delete Operation**: Only removes members that are defined in the Terraform state, leaving externally managed members untouched
- **State Management**: Maintains a clean separation between Terraform-managed and externally managed members

This resource is particularly useful in environments where:
- Multiple teams or tools manage group members
- You want to avoid conflicts between Terraform and manual member management
- You need to ensure Terraform only manages specific members without affecting others
- You want to add members to a self-serve group in a different domain

## Example Usage

IMPORTANT NOTE: please do NOT use json syntax but only hcl syntax

```hcl
resource "athenz_self_serve_group_members" "foo_group" {
  name = "some_name"
  domain = "some_domain"
  member {
    name = "domain1.user1"
    expiration = "2022-12-29 23:59:59"
  }
  member {
    name = "domain2.user2"
    expiration = "2022-12-29 23:59:59"
  }
  member {
    name = "domain3.user3"
  }
  audit_ref = "manage group membership"
}
```
